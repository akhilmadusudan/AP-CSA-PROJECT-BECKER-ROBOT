# AP-CSA-PROJECT-BECKER-ROBOT
In this project, we utilized the becker robot java package to create a 2d animated maze where a robot completes the maze and the tasks accompanied by it. After running the program, you can see that the robot moves through each section of the maze (4), and picks up the item (yellow ball) at the end of each section and out it in its “backpack”, after doing so, we can see the robot go to the last section dropping each item it picked up back to back. This is accomplished by creating our own methods and using the methods offered by the package. The program is run by running the A23.java file and clicking start when the 2D java application opens. Just click “start” and watch the power of Becker Robots!
